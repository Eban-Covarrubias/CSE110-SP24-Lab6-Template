1. The best place to fit automated tests would be within a github action that runs whenever code is pushed, this is because this will provide reliable instant feed back to developers who are trying to push their code and make sure that the process of testing is efficient and automated.
2. No, because end to end tests are specifically to simulate user interactions to check several aspects of the app, if I wanted purely to check results I would use unit tests.
